% Writer's Bootcamp: The DRAW Method

% April 8, 2010

Every two weeks, we at ProfHacker publish articles about how to be
productive in your writing. All the suggestions we provide actually
work. That is, they work for some people some of the time. But they do
work. A writer’s goal, aside from producing text, is to find tricks and
tips that work, and those tips change from person to person. Today we
present a different type of tip: “The DRAW method” of writing. This
method can work for everyone.

The DRAW method is a 20-minute program that gets you writing each day.
All you need is a timer (and we’ve written about these before), and
something to write about. The DRAW Method stands for:

**D:** Declutter

**R:** Read

**A:** Assess

**W:** Write

-   **Declutter:**Set your timer for five minutes, and clear your desk
    while the clock ticks. Maybe you clear the surface of your desk.
    Maybe you clean out one file drawer. Maybe you straighten the books
    on your shelf. Whatever it is you need to do to declutter your
    workspace (and by extension, your mind), you can do. But just spend
    five minutes. You’ll be able to spend five minutes tomorrow clearing
    something else. (I tend to be a bit obsessive about thinking I
    “need” to clean before I can write. Setting the timer keeps me from
    doing laundry, washing dishes, and walking the dog. I only spend
    five minutes decluttering.) When the timer goes off, you can move to
    the next stage: **Read**.

-   **Read:**To get your mind ready for words, pick up a book, and spend
    five minutes reading. Maybe this reading is related to your major
    writing project, or maybe it’s something fun (a magazine, a
    newspaper). Remember, you only have five minutes, but notice the
    words on the page. Recognize the sentence structure, the vocabulary,
    the descriptions. (I tend to read texts that inspire me.) When the
    timer goes off, you can move to the next stage: **Assess**.

-   **Assess:**Spend five minutes assessing your current projects. What
    is the most important of all the things you have to do? What is the
    most interesting? What do you need to first? Where do you need to
    focus your energies today? As you assess your projects, you can
    prioritize them. (I tend to group my writing, sources, and notes
    together and place them in piles on the floor. This helps me “see”
    the work I have to get done.) When the timer goes off, you can move
    to the next stage: **Write**.

-   **Write:**Finally, you can write. You can continue to use your
    timer, spending five minutes (or whatever is comfortable for you) on
    each project or each aspect of the larger project. The timer is
    fundamental, though. Give yourself a set number of minutes to write.
    When the timer stops, you can check email or Twitter. But use the
    timer to keep your “breaks” to short intervals of time. Then get
    back to work writing.
